''' I Encoded here the Class Definition (`ml_Hero`): The class `ml_Hero` is created to represent a hero in a game. 
Each hero has three characteristics: name, role, and dmg_type

Second, I also include the Constructor (`__init__` method): When a new hero is created,
the `__init__` method is automatically 
called to set the hero's `name`, `role`, 
and `dmg_type` attributes based on the information given.

Describe Method (`describe`): This method returns a simple description of the hero,
mentioning their name and role.
 For example, "Nolan is a Jungler/Assassin hero."

String Representation (`__str__` method): When you print the hero object, 
this method is called to return a more detailed description of the hero, including their name,
role, and the type of damage they deal.
 For example, "Nolan is a Jungler/Assassin and deals Physical Type damage."

Hero Instances: Five different hero objects are created, each with their own `name`, `role`, and `dmg_type`.

User Interaction: The program prompts the user to press any key to start, and then simulates game activity '''
